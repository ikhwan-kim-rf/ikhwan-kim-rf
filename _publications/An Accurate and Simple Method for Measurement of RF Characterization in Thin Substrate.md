excerpt: 'This paper presents that dielectric constant and loss tangent can be obtained using only two different microstrip lines in a measurement environment despite the thin substrate. It is impossible to calculate the conductor loss and radiation loss exactly only using theory. Therefore, in this paper, using 3-D electromagnetic solver CST Microwave Studio (MWS), the conductor loss was obtained and radiation loss was neglected. As result, in this paper, the dielectric constant has errors of 0.53% and 1.46%, in simulation and measurement each.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
